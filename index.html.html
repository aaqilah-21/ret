            The entry of Nawaloka Hospitals into the state dominated healthcare sector in 1985, saw the private health care system take root in Sri Lanka.The launch of the hospital and the overwhelming 
            response it received from the people demonstrated a long felt need for superior healthcare in a pleasant environment.
            As Sri Lankaâ€™s first premier multi-specialty hospital, Nawaloka was set up to mirror reputed hospitals in the region which offered advanced medical technology and expert medical care, 
            thus eliminating the need for people to travel out of Sri Lanka for specialized medical treatment. The Hospital was a pioneering initiative, established under the Chairmanship of 
            Late Deshamanya H. K. Dharmadasa, to be a centre of excellence in high technology diagnostic and curative facilities. Driven by the Vision to be the Hospital of Tomorrow, the medical institution 
            has come to be known as a centre of excellence and a preferred healthcare institution in the country. </font>
